noc0014@cell16-cse:~/Rubik-s-Cube-Algorithm-Grp3/backend$

Looking at your output, the issue is clear: your Rubik's Cube solver is expecting standard Rubik's Cube notation (like U, R, F, D, L, B with optional prime marks), but you're entering color names (G for Green, W for White, O for Orange) instead of face rotation moves.

The Problem
In Rubik's Cube notation:

U, D, L, R, F, B represent the six faces (Up, Down, Left, Right, Front, Back)
Prime (') indicates a counterclockwise rotation
Colors (W, R, G, Y, O, B) are NOT valid moves - they're just the colors of the faces
The Fix
You have a few options to resolve this:

Option 1: Use Correct Notation (Recommended)
Simply use proper Rubik's Cube moves instead of color names:

bash
# Instead of: B' G R W O'
# Use: B' F R U D'

# Instead of: B' R W O  
# Use: B' R U D

# Instead of: R' O B
# Use: R' D B
Option 2: Add Color-to-Move Mapping (If Required by Assignment)
If your assignment specifically requires accepting color inputs, you'll need to modify your code to map colors to moves. Add this to your Cube.cpp or Utilities.cpp:

cpp
std::string translateColorToMove(const std::string& input) {
    std::map<std::string, std::string> colorToMove = {
        {"W", "U"},   // White -> Up
        {"Y", "D"},   // Yellow -> Down  
        {"R", "R"},   // Red -> Right
        {"O", "L"},   // Orange -> Left
        {"G", "F"},   // Green -> Front
        {"B", "B"}    // Blue -> Back
    };
    
    std::string move = input;
    std::string prime = "";
    
    // Check for prime notation
    if (move.back() == '\'') {
        prime = "'";
        move.pop_back();
    }
    
    if (colorToMove.find(move) != colorToMove.end()) {
        return colorToMove[move] + prime;
    }
    
    return input; // Return original if not a color
}
Option 3: Update Input Validation
Modify your move validation to provide clearer error messages:

cpp
void validateMove(const std::string& move) {
    std::set<std::string> validMoves = {
        "U", "U'", "D", "D'", "L", "L'", 
        "R", "R'", "F", "F'", "B", "B'"
    };
    
    if (validMoves.find(move) == validMoves.end()) {
        std::cerr << "Error: '" << move << "' is not a valid move.\n";
        std::cerr << "Valid moves are: U, U', D, D', L, L', R, R', F, F', B, B'\n";
        std::cerr << "Colors (W, G, R, Y, O, B) are not valid moves.\n";
        throw std::invalid_argument("Illegal move: " + move);
    }
}
Quick Test
Your solver works correctly with proper notation, as shown in your last successful run:

> U' R F D 
Solution (4 moves): D' F' R' U
The simplest fix is to use standard Rubik's Cube notation instead of color names. If you need to support color input for your specific assignment requirements, implement the color-to-move mapping as shown above.

WWWWWWWWWRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGYYYYYYYYYOOOOOOOOOBBBBBBBBB
noc0014@cell16-cse:~/Rubik-s-Cube-Algorithm-Grp3/backend$

Yes, this output indicates your solver is working correctly! Here's what each part means:

✅ What This Shows
Input Accepted: Your solver correctly parsed the scramble sequence U' R F F' D D' L L' B'
Efficient Solution Found:
Input: 9 moves to scramble
Solution: Only 3 moves to solve (B R' U)
This is excellent optimization!
Solution Verified: The "Verified solved!" message means your solver:
Applied the solution moves to the scrambled cube
Checked isSolved() and confirmed it returned true
Correct Solved State: The final string WWWWWWWWWRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGYYYYYYYYYOOOOOOOOOBBBBBBBBB represents a solved cube where each face shows a single color (all W's for one face, all R's for another, etc.)
🔍 Why 3 Moves vs 9 Moves?
Your input sequence had redundant moves:

F F' cancels out (F followed by F-inverse)
D D' cancels out
L L' cancels out
So effectively you scrambled with: U' R B' And the solution B R' U is the exact inverse sequence, which is mathematically correct!

✅ This Demonstrates Your Solver is Working Because:
Correct parsing of Rubik's cube notation
Proper BFS implementation finding an optimal solution
Accurate state representation and move execution
Working verification system confirming the solution is valid
Efficient search (found 3-move solution quickly within depth 20)
Your Rubik's Cube solver appears to be implemented correctly and working as expected!




but isnt it not layering?

You're absolutely right to question this! The issue is with the scramble sequence you entered, not necessarily the solver itself.

The Problem: Ineffective Scrambling
Your input: U' R F F' D D' L L' B'

When we simplify this:

F F' = no movement (F cancels with F')
D D' = no movement (D cancels with D')
L L' = no movement (L cancels with L')
Effective scramble: U' R B'

This is only 3 moves, so it's not surprising the cube isn't really scrambled much. The solver just needs to reverse these 3 moves: B R' U.

Test with a Real Scramble
Try a proper scramble that doesn't have canceling moves:

bash
> R U R' F R F' U F U' F'
Or:

bash
> R U' R' D R D' U R U' R'
These sequences will actually scramble the cube significantly and force your BFS to work harder.

What "Layering" Means
In Rubik's cube solving, layering refers to solving the cube layer by layer (bottom → middle → top). Your BFS solver doesn't use layering - it tries all possible move combinations until it finds the shortest path to the solved state.

If you want to test whether your solver can handle properly scrambled cubes, try:

bash
./solver
> R U R U R U R U R U R U
This will create a real scramble that requires more complex solving, not just reversing 3 simple moves.

Your solver is likely correct - you just need to test it with scrambles that actually scramble the cube!

Correct Input
Just enter the moves without the >:

Enter scramble moves (space-separated). Empty line = solved cube.
> R U R' F R F' U F U' F'
Try These Test Scrambles
Here are some good scrambles to test your solver:

Simple scramble (should solve quickly):

R U R' U'
Medium scramble:

R U R' F R F' U F U' F'
More complex scramble:

R U2 R' D R D' U2 R U' R'
Very scrambled (may take longer):

R U R U R U R U R U R U
Just make sure to only type the moves after the > prompt, without including the > symbol itself!

This is my friends code How can i implement some of this in mine to be better and what files should i put it in

Looking at your friend's code and comparing it to your project structure, here are the key improvements you can implement:

1. Enhanced Cube Representation (Add to Cube.h and Cube.cpp)
Your friend uses individual face arrays which is cleaner than a single vector. Add this to your Cube.h:

cpp
class Cube {
private:
    std::array<char, 9> up, down, left, right, front, back;
    
    // Helper methods for face rotation
    void rotateFaceCW(std::array<char, 9>& face);
    void rotateFaceCCW(std::array<char, 9>& face);
    
public:
    // Constructor from scramble moves
    Cube(const std::vector<std::string>& scrambleMoves = {});
    
    // Move methods
    void U(); void U_prime();
    void R(); void R_prime();
    void F(); void F_prime();
    void D(); void D_prime();
    void L(); void L_prime();
    void B(); void B_prime();
    
    // Your existing methods
    void applyMove(const std::string& move);
    bool isSolved() const;
    std::string getStateHash() const;
    
    // New utility methods
    void printCube() const;
    bool operator==(const Cube& other) const;
};
2. Better Face Rotation Logic (Add to Cube.cpp)
cpp
void Cube::rotateFaceCW(std::array<char, 9>& face) {
    std::array<char, 9> temp = face;
    face[0] = temp[6]; face[1] = temp[3]; face[2] = temp[0];
    face[3] = temp[7]; face[4] = temp[4]; face[5] = temp[1];
    face[6] = temp[8]; face[7] = temp[5]; face[8] = temp[2];
}

void Cube::rotateFaceCCW(std::array<char, 9>& face) {
    std::array<char, 9> temp = face;
    face[0] = temp[2]; face[1] = temp[5]; face[2] = temp[8];
    face[3] = temp[1]; face[4] = temp[4]; face[5] = temp[7];
    face[6] = temp[0]; face[7] = temp[3]; face[8] = temp[6];
}
3. Improved Move Implementation (Update Cube.cpp)
Instead of hardcoding moves, implement them systematically:

cpp
void Cube::U() {
    rotateFaceCW(up);
    // Rotate adjacent edges
    std::array<char, 3> temp = {front[0], front[1], front[2]};
    front[0] = right[0]; front[1] = right[1]; front[2] = right[2];
    right[0] = back[0]; right[1] = back[1]; right[2] = back[2];
    back[0] = left[0]; back[1] = left[1]; back[2] = left[2];
    left[0] = temp[0]; left[1] = temp[1]; left[2] = temp[2];
}

void Cube::U_prime() {
    U(); U(); U(); // Three clockwise = one counter-clockwise
}
4. Enhanced State Comparison (Add to Cube.cpp)
cpp
bool Cube::operator==(const Cube& other) const {
    return up == other.up && down == other.down && 
           left == other.left && right == other.right &&
           front == other.front && back == other.back;
}

bool Cube::isSolved() const {
    auto checkFace = [](const std::array<char, 9>& face) {
        char center = face[4];
        return std::all_of(face.begin(), face.end(), 
                          [center](char c) { return c == center; });
    };
    
    return checkFace(up) && checkFace(down) && checkFace(left) && 
           checkFace(right) && checkFace(front) && checkFace(back);
}
5. Better Debugging Output (Add to Utilities.h and Utilities.cpp)
cpp
// In Utilities.h
void printCubeState(const Cube& cube);
void printMoveSequence(const std::vector<std::string>& moves);

// In Utilities.cpp
void printCubeState(const Cube& cube) {
    std::cout << "Current cube state:\n";
    cube.printCube();
    std::cout << "Solved: " << (cube.isSolved() ? "Yes" : "No") << "\n\n";
}
6. Enhanced Input Validation (Update main.cpp)
cpp
// In main.cpp
bool isValidMove(const std::string& move) {
    static const std::set<std::string> validMoves = {
        "U", "U'", "R", "R'", "F", "F'", 
        "D", "D'", "L", "L'", "B", "B'"
    };
    return validMoves.count(move) > 0;
}

std::vector<std::string> parseInput(const std::string& input) {
    std::istringstream iss(input);
    std::vector<std::string> moves;
    std::string move;
    
    while (iss >> move) {
        if (!isValidMove(move)) {
            throw std::invalid_argument("Invalid move: " + move + 
                "\nValid moves: U, U', R, R', F, F', D, D', L, L', B, B'");
        }
        moves.push_back(move);
    }
    return moves;
}
7. File Organization Summary
Cube.h: Add face arrays, rotation methods, comparison operators
Cube.cpp: Implement systematic move functions and face rotations
Utilities.h/cpp: Add debugging and validation functions
main.cpp: Improve input parsing and error messages
Solver_BFS.cpp: Keep your existing BFS logic but use the improved Cube class
8. Key Improvements to Adopt
Cleaner face representation with individual arrays
Systematic move implementation instead of hardcoded matrices
Better debugging output to visualize cube states
Robust input validation with clear error messages
Proper face rotation logic that's easier to understand
The main advantage of your friend's approach is the clarity and maintainability - each face is separate, moves are implemented systematically, and the code is easier to debug. Your BFS algorithm can stay the same, but with a more robust underlying Cube class.
